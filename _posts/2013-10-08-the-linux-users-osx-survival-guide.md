(Or... how to get work done on a Mac if you're a Linux junky.)
---

While normally a Linux user, my [current employer][1] has very kindly (and through great institutional effort) supplied me with a gorgeous MacBook Air. I was a Mac user about eight years ago (OSX Tiger!), but switched to Linux full-time a couple years after that, when I realized I just felt more productive in that environment.

The few can't live without 'em features for me in Linux include:

1. Remapping CapsLock to Esc (for vim).
2. The select to copy, middle click to paste clipboard.
3. Middle click to open a new browser tab.

We'll tackle them one-by-one.

### Remapping CapsLock to Esc in OS X

You'll need [PCKeyboardHack][2] for this one. It will allow you to change the code generated by the CapsLock key. Set it to `53`. The PCKeyboardHack site also says you should go in the OS X system preferences (System Prefs. > Keyboard > Modifier Keys) and set the CapsLock key to "No Action" to avoid experiencing a delay, although I didn't find it necessary and haven't noticed any sluggishness.

### Emulating Linux's Select/Copy Middle-Click/Paste

This little-known feature is totally a killer app. One-handed copy and paste with no keyboard input needed. Alternatively, if your hand ends up away from the mouse, you can also hit `Shift-Insert` to paste from Linux's special clipboard. I am lost without it. The directions I found online are a bit confused, but after some trial and error, I got it working: select and three-finger tap to paste in [iTerm2][3]. 
 
First, you need to set up the association between three-finger tap and middle click in iTerm. Go to iTerm > Preferences > Pointer. At the bottom, under "Miscellaneous Settings" check the box "Three-finger tap reports middle click to apps." But that alone doesn't seem to do the trick. In order to get this working, I had to install and keep [MiddleClick (for Mountain Lion)][4] running in my system tray.

Two-finger drag to select still has horrible performance in iTerm, however. Please tweet at me if you have an answer for that!

### Three-Finger Tap to Open a New Browser Tab

Surprise! This one got fixed as a side-effect of installing MiddleClick. You're welcome. :)

*I am writing this post about a month after resolving these issues, so please [let me know][5] if anything here didn't work out for you, and I will investigate my system settings further.*
